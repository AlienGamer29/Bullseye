Great job — this code is well structured and easy to navigate. It’s a strong start for your portfolio!

Before showcasing it, here are a few minor improvements you can make:

Clean up unused code: Remove any unused methods. For example, there are a few in the Player class and one in the Sfx class.

Add comments following Java conventions: This will not only make the code easier to understand but also allow you to generate Java-style documentation for your project.

Refactor constructor logic: In the Player class, consider moving the picture-handling logic out of the constructor and into the displayPlayer method. This will make the constructor cleaner and the code more cohesive.

Overall, the code is very good — you’re on the right track. Keep up the great work!
